Account data:
	+Easy extraction
	+Unique ID
	-Not saved in rafalh database (no backups)
	-No autologin - can check all accounts to find that one (or client-side)

rafalh_players:
	+Backups
	+Easy autologin
	+Selecting of players without account
	-Slightly worser access - not a problem
	-Not unique ID (needs more queries) - hmm
	-Passwords in database (only if autologin is serverside)
	

Autologin:
	We need passwords because MTA is stupid so save it client-side (don't trust admins).
	
Now script needs to attach player id with each account
Account data:
	Saves variable name for each account (stupid).
	
rafalh_players:
	Not unique
