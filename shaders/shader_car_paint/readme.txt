This is a modified shader_car_paint resource from shader examples at:
http://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Shader_examples

And by modified i mean 1 line in the effect (.fx) file. Still i think it was worth uploading.
What it does is get rid of this annoying (for me) pinkish color on whiter vehicles.
So .. that's it. Nothing more.

have fun
