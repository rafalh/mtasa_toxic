Resource: Shader Car Paint reflect v0.3.3

The reflection is based on screen source, giving an illusion 
of realtime reflection. Effect is similar to what is seen in ENB.  
It is applied to vehicle paint and windshields.
The effect requires (just as the carpaint shader) PS Model 2.0 GFX.
So it will run on almost anything.

Update 0.3.3
-shatterShader has been disabled due to recent bug that disables windshield alpha

have fun
